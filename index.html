                                Refunds typically undergo a thorough review process, which can vary based on several factors including payment method, bank processing times, and any specific policies related to your booking. 
                                Rest assured, we are actively working to expedite the process as much as possible. 
                                Our refund team will notify you via email once the refund is processed. 
                                You may also check the refund status on our website under the 'My Bookings' section.

                                This means you can expect to see your refund within 10-15 business days. We're committed to transparency and will keep you informed every step of the way.

                                Rest assured, we're doing all we can to speed up this refund process. Normally, once we get the go-ahead from the airline, we aim to sort it out within about 6 days. But sometimes, delays beyond our control can be caused.

                                Normally, once we get the go-ahead from the airline, we aim to sort it out within about 6 days.

                                Therefore, you can expect to receive your refund within 10 to 15 business days.

                                The price of a ticket is based on demand and set by the airline – the fare is higher for the date and time you are choosing than the ticket you originally paid for. 
                                If you are flexible, I can search for 2 to 3 different travel dates/times for a lesser fare difference. 
                                Would you like me to do that?

                                4. The doctor must use the Gotogate doctor's certificate (I will send the link via email): this is the only doctor's certificate we accept.

                                We totally get how frustrating it can be when things take longer than expected, 
                                and we're really sorry if this delay has caused any inconvenience to you. 
                                Rest assured, we're doing all we can to speed up this refund process. 
                                Normally, once we get the go-ahead from the airline, we aim to sort it out within about 6 days. 
                                But sometimes, delays beyond our control can be caused.
